This python code has 3 function within it. The first is the buy stock function, which essentially buys however many shares of 1 stock the user wants to buy and stores it based on the investor ID passed thru. There are a total of 7 stocks ( NVDA, AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, META, AMZN, GOOGL). The second function is get transaction info, this allows the user to pass a transaction ID and find out what was bought at that specific transaction and what investor ID purchased it. the third is view the stock shares. this allows the user to view their total stock shares total throughout each portfolio based on the investor ID.
